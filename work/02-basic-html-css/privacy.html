            address, and mailing address if someone else provides it
            to us so we can communicate with you on their behalf
            about a fundraising opportunity. For example, if your
            friend creates a fundraising page on our Services, your
            friend may provide us with your email address so he/she
            can use our Services to notify you about the fundraising
            page via email.
        </li>
        <li>
            Information from Third Parties. We like to know about
            the individuals who make donations to us, so we can
            communicate with them more effectively and adjust our
            outreach efforts. For this reason, we may collect
            information from third parties about our donors,
            including demographic and contact information, and
            combine it with information we collect from donors.

            (“Integrated Services”). When you connect to an
            Integrated Service, we will receive information that the
